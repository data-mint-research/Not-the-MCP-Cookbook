# Appendix H: Advanced Workflow Orchestration

This appendix explores how MCP systems can be composed into larger workflows using orchestration tools like **LangGraph**, **Autogen**, and custom hosts. These approaches combine agent autonomy with the structure and security of MCP.

## üîÅ What is Agent Orchestration?
Agent orchestration coordinates multiple LLM agents, tools, memory components, and user interactions into coherent workflows. Orchestration handles:
- State tracking
- Tool selection
- Role-based decisions
- Looping and branching

MCP provides the **transport and security layer** for these workflows.

---

## üß© LangGraph + MCP Integration
LangGraph defines workflows as **state machines over agents**.

### MCP Pattern
- Each node is an MCP-compatible agent (via Client+Host)
- Tools are mapped to `tool/call` nodes
- Context transitions via `sampling/createMessage`

### Benefits
- Strict state transitions
- Deterministic execution
- Built-in observability

### Example Node
```python
@graph.node()
def summarize(state):
    result = mcp_host.call_tool("summarize-doc", state["doc"])
    state["summary"] = result
    return state
```

---

## üß† Autogen + MCP Pattern
Autogen agents operate via functions and system prompts.

### MCP Pattern
- Wrap MCP `tool/call` as an Autogen tool
- Implement `function_call` ‚Üí Host ‚Üí Server
- Use MCP Server as the secure backend for external actions

### Example Tool
```python
def run_git_pull(params):
    return mcp_host.call_tool("git/pull", params)
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Host Workflows
Custom MCP Hosts can hardcode orchestration logic:
- `if tool fails ‚Üí try alternative`
- `if output == error ‚Üí retry`
- `chain prompt ‚Üí tool ‚Üí sample ‚Üí prompt`

```python
# Pattern: auto-retry on error
resp = call_tool("transpile", params)
if "error" in resp:
    log("Retrying with fallback...")
    resp = call_tool("transpile-legacy", params)
```

---

## üß≠ Workflow as Data
Workflows can be serialized and versioned:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "action": "tool/call", "id": "extract-json" },
    { "action": "prompt/render", "template": "summarize-json" },
    { "action": "sampling/createMessage" }
  ]
}
```

Stored as `.workflow.json` or registered via API.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Use `root` scoping to contain each agent or step
- Track all transitions and results per session ID
- Log every step, error, and recovery path
- Use Hosts to wrap branching logic cleanly

---

MCP-compliant orchestration unlocks powerful agent workflows with safe, explainable execution. Future chapters will include orchestration templates, real-time dashboards, and retry/rescue systems.
